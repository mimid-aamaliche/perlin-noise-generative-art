# Perlin Noise Generative Art

This is a minimalist generative art project using **Perlin noise** in JavaScript. It creates smooth, abstract visual patterns on an HTML5 canvas in real time.

The goal is to experiment with noise functions and visual randomness to generate interesting visuals using basic 2D rendering logic.
